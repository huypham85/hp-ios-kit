# Capture Simulator Screenshot

Take a screenshot of the currently booted iOS Simulator and display it for analysis.

## What This Does

1. Checks if a simulator is booted
2. Captures screenshot to timestamped file
3. Displays the screenshot (Claude is multimodal!)
4. Returns the file path for reference

## Usage

Simply run this command and Claude will:
- Execute: `xcrun simctl io booted screenshot /tmp/screenshot-<timestamp>.png`
- Read and display the screenshot
- Analyze what's visible in the screenshot

## Prerequisites

- An iOS Simulator must be booted
- If no simulator is running, Claude will boot one first

## Common Use Cases

**Debug Visual Issues**:
```bash
/hp:screenshot
```
Then ask: "Does the login button look centered?"

**Verify Fixes**:
```bash
/hp:screenshot
```
Then ask: "Is the text still clipped?"

**Document Current State**:
```bash
/hp:screenshot
```
Claude will capture and describe the current UI state.

## For More Control

For advanced simulator testing (location, push notifications, video recording, etc.), use:
```bash
/hp:test-simulator
```

Or invoke the full simulator-tester agent with natural language:
- "Test my app with location simulation"
- "Send a test push notification"
- "Record a video of the app"
